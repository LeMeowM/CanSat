# CanSat
CanSAT CircuitPy Project for launch in switzerland

This is the source code of the entire project that will run through CircuitPython on a RaspberryPi Zero 2 W.


We will need to convert everything from `.py` files to `.mpy` files through the [converter](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=bin/mpy-cross/) to be able to reduce memory footprint and compile time checks once we have all of this done.
